# Graph VAMB
Hi, This is Xinyuan's master thesis project about Metagenomic Binning using Graph Neural Network.

There are three different GNN models based on VAMB. GraphSage-VAMB and GAT-VAMB are two models that use corresponding graph encoders to replace the original linear layer in VAE's encoder. Cosdistloss-VAMB model keep the main structure of VAMB, but applying a new additional graph-based loss 'Cosdistloss'. The main principle of these three models are listed below.

## Cosdistloss

## GraphSAGE

## GAT
